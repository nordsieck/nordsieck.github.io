title:  "Walk Signs Done Right"

One of the things that Washington DC does right is walk signs.  In most places
that I've been, walk signs are the white/blue walking person that transitions
into a red hand, sometimes with an associated number.  In DC, they go one step
further, and start the number with the blue walking person immediately.  It's
amazingly user friendly.  If you're a ways a way from an intersection, you can
easily judge if you can make the light if you hurry a bit.

I have no idea why Washington DC has a monopoly on this amazing idea, but it
surely needs to spread.
