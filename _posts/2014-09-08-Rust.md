title:  "Learning Rust"
---
Looking around at the languages being developed and their
communities, I think I've landed on the two languages I'm
going to try to seriously learn and use over the next few
decades.  Those are rust and clojure.  I'm just learning
rust and it's pretty great already.  For example, here is
FizzBuzz:

```rust
fn main() {
    for n in range (1i, 101) {
        print!("{}", fizz_buzz(n));
    }
    println!("")
}

fn fizz_buzz(num: int) -> String {
    match num % 15 {
        0              => { "FizzBuzz".to_str() }
	5 | 10         => { "Buzz".to_str() }
	3 | 6 | 9 | 12 => { "Fizz".to_str() }
	_              => { num.to_str() }
    }
}

#[test]
fn test_fizz_buzz() {
    if fizz_buzz(2) != "2".to_str() { fail!() }
    if fizz_buzz(3) != "Fizz".to_str() { fail!() }
    if fizz_buzz(4) != "4".to_str() { fail!() }
    if fizz_buzz(5) != "Buzz".to_str() { fail!() }
    if fizz_buzz(15) != "FizzBuzz".to_str() { fail!() }
    if fizz_buzz(16) != "16".to_str() { fail!() }
}
```

It would be nice if the testing facilities did a bit more
on their own, but they are certainly nice enough.
