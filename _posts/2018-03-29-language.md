title:  "Respect for language"
---
Rich Hickey is one of my favorite software development speakers. I think one
of the things that makes him special, among a throng of other great speakers
is his respect for language. Every talk he gives usually involves a number
of definitions of words, and those definitions are sometimes deeply insightful
([complect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0&t=16m9s) being my
favorite).
