title:  "The Central Idea of Minimalism"
---
Having been exposed a bit ot Minimalism, as well has Hoarding, it seem to me that the central idea of Minimalism is this:

Every object you own decreases the utility of every other object you own.

This is an injunction against owning things, but more an injunction against owning objects that have a net negative impact on your life.
