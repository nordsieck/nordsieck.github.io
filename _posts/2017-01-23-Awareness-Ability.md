title:  "Awareness and Ability"
---

I've come to believe that there are two components to performace:
awareness and ability.  In general, they both have to improve before
someone improves their performance.

It is possible to have a deep imbalance between the two.  We call
people with way more awareness than ability "critics" and people with
way more ability than awareness "naturals".

I suspect that it is difficult to improve with such an imbalance,
though, and that many times people who have plateaus are actually
in the process of growing their awareness faster than their ability.
