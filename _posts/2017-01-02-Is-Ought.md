In one sense ethical propositions exist in and of themselves.  They
can be true, false or even something else entirely without relation
to the physical world.

In another sense, however, ethical propositions only exist if there
is someone to believe them.  In this way, ideas are exposed to the
process of evolution in the same way that biological organisms are.
