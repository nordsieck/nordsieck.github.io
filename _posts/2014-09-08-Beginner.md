title:  "Beginner Gains"
---
Today was a rush.  I'm taking a beginner class in West
Coast Swing and the instructor invited me to stay and
follow in the intermediate class.  The difficulty was
just right - everything was new, but if I really
concentrated I could get the footwork mostly right and
use my general dance skills to follow the movement as a
whole.

Deep knowlege is a great thing.  When I was younger, I
never really had the patience to cultivate it.  Now that
I'm older, I want to get good at a few things instead of
being a dillitant.

For me, though, it is a bit of a grind to get there.
Beginner gains are a rush - getting noticibly better in a
short amount of time is a fantastic feeling - one that
I'll have to remember in the future when I feel like I
need to recharge my motivation after a long grind on deep
knowlege.
