title:  "Practical Persuasion"
---
It's interesting to me that practical persuasion isn't taken very seriously. There
are dribs and drabs spread out all over the place. Books like
[Influence](https://amazon.com/dp/006124189X) and
[The Culture Code](https://amazon.com/dp/B00FGVXP9Q) have bits and pieces of the
puzzle, but I haven't seen a holistic treatment of the subject.

Some examples:

* Rhyming. It used to be that poetry was a technology that empowered people's
  memories. That mantle has since been taken up by rap. Regardless of who uses it
  well, it's pretty clear that it's an effective tool for convincing people of
  beliefs and making those beliefs memorable.
* Graphic imagery. This, in part, is what poetry moved to from rhyming. Similar to
  rhyming it can be inconsistent; for those people upon whom it works well, graphic
  imagery is one of the most powerful ways to engage the imagination and cement a
  belief in that person's mind.
* The various logical fallacies. Too many to list individually, but they all work
  to one degree or another.
* Value alignment. Telling people what they want to hear.
