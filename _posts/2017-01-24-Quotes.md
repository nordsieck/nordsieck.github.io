> in his calling. -Hagakure

> You should hire me because I will work harder than anyone else you’re
> going to talk to. On Sunday evenings I process all of my email and
> write out my goals for the week. I show up an hour before everyone
> else each morning to make the coffee and get my most important task
> for the day done. I spend as many lunches and breakfasts as possible
> with prospective or current clients. And I take the local train
> instead of the express so I can write thank you cards or notes to
> clients. That’s why you should hire me. -a Marine as told by Sean Johnson
