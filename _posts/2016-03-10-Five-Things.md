EDC.  Every day carry.

Over the years, I've tried carrying a bunch of different things with me.  Over time, I've come to appreciate a smaller, lighter weight collection of things to carry with me.  If I don't use something all the time, or it's bulky or heavy, it's probably time to find a substitute, or to ditch it all together.

For me, five things have stood the test of time.

1. Keys: I have as few keys as possible on my keychain and no unnecessary dangly bits.  I do have 2 dog tags with my blood type and allergies on them.  I could probably ditch them, but I guess I feel a bit like they connect me to my past.  The keys are on a medium length of paracord.  The original reason for the paracord was so that I could wear the keys around my neck when/if I went running.  These days, the paracord is so that the keys can hang round the door to my appartment, so that I won't forget them and lock myself out.

2. Money clip: I've tried a number of wallets over the years.  They work reasonably well with baggier pants, but once I made the switch to more fitted pants, the space in my pockets got much more scarse.  It's not a particularly good money clip, but it gets the job done, as long as the number of cards I keep with me stays relatively static.

3. [Earplugs](/2015/07/24/Earplugs.html): I use these all the time.  ALL THE TIME.  I think the times when they're really great is when the environment is noisy, but not super noisy.  Putting them in turns a library in real life into a library in the movies.

4. Knife: Kershaw Skyline.  This thing is amazing.  2.5 ounces.  .73 blade to body ratio.  3 inch blade.  G10 handle.  Mid-grade commodity steel.  $25 on sale.  I couldn't ask for a better knife - it's probably the best knife I've ever owned.

5. Iphone 5.  This is actually the first smartphone I've ever owned.  Getting used to charging it regularly has been a challenge.  That being said, it's pretty amazing.  It's definitely the right size - 4 inches is probably as big as I'll ever want to go.  In theory it might be nice to have a thinner phone, but it doesn't seem like the new phones are that much thinner, and my pockets just don't have space for a 5" phone.
