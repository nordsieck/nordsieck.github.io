title:  "Monitor"

After hearing about so may people using the
[Seki 4k TV](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DOPGO2G) as
a monitor, I was definitely intrigued.

After seeing the TV in person and being able to use it
for a few hours, I was completely sold.

This is easily the best monitor I've ever used.

Let me be clear before I sing its praises - it is really
only good as a work monitor - the abreviated color depth
really hurts it.

That being said, for work, it is amazing.  I normally
have 4 full height windows tiled side-by-side.  Activities
that would often require the use of 2-3 virtual desktops can
now be accomplished on a single screen.
