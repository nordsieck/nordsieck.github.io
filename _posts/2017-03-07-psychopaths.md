title:  "The Most Important Book"
---
I believe that the most important book in the world is [The Psychopath Code
](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016MRW9KS).  The book is written by someome without
any credentials in social science, but nonetheless, I believe that what it
describes is true.

The core thesis of the book is that there are two competing strategies in humans.
The majority strategy is what might be called altruism.  Altruistic humans try
to form long lasting relationships with each other that are mutually beneficial.
This typically involves a certain amount of screening with increasing trust as
the relationships progresses.

The other type of relationship that people engage in is predatory.  The author
uses the term "psychopath", not in the medical sense, but in the colloquial sense.
Psychopaths attempt to psychologically dominate altruists in order to take
their resources.

One of the key reasons the author believes that psychopaths (he lumps in a
bunch of different diagnoses like bpd, narcissists, etc.) are predators rather
than damaged people is how well adjusted they are.  They don't generally suffer
psychological damage from their own behavior (e.g. depression).  That is generally
reserved for their victims.
