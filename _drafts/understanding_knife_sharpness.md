title:  "Understanding Knife Sharpness"
---
Knife sharpness is all about geometry.

Types of grinds:
* saber / full
* flat / hollow (concave) / convex
* asymmetrical
* distal taper
* scandi / secondary bevel

Types of blade profiles:

#### Primary Bevel Initiation

The primary bevel can either start at the spine, in which case it is called a "full" grind. Alternatively, it can have a flat portion between the spine and the start of the primary grind; this is typically called a "saber grind".

#### Bevel Shape

A bevel can either be flat, convex or concave. Concave bevels are typically called "hollow" ground. Knives are typically not concave, but some axes are.

#### Bevel Symmetry

Bevels can be perfectly symmetrical (50%/50%), totally asymmetrical (0%/100%), or somehwere in between (30%/70%). Most European knives are symmetrically ground, with the exception of straight razors. Many Japanese knives are asymmetrically ground.

#### Distal Taper

Blade properties:

* weight
* agility (weight distribution)
* balance point
* sectional density
* frontal surface area
